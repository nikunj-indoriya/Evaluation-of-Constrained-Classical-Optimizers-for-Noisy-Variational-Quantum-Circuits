# Evaluation of Constrained Classical Optimizers for Noisy Variational Quantum Circuits

This project investigates the performance of various classical optimization algorithms applied to noisy variational quantum circuits. It focuses on the integration of realistic constraints such as circuit depth, hardware noise, and parameter variance â€” factors that are crucial in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era.
